# ADR-07: Tracing & Logging Technology â€“ OpenTelemetry

## Status - accepted

## Context
Modern distributed applications require robust tracing and logging for monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization. Several solutions exist for this purpose, including but not limited to:

- **OpenTelemetry** (emerging open standard for observability)
- **Prometheus** (metrics-focused, some tracing support via integrations)
- **Zipkin**/ **Jaeger** (dedicated distributed tracing systems)
- **AWS X-Ray**, **Google Cloud Trace**, **Datadog**, **NewRelic** (vendor-managed solutions)
- **Opencensus** (predecessor to OpenTelemetry, less actively maintained)

Requirements include:
- Support for distributed tracing and contextual logging.
- Integration with multiple languages, cloud providers, and frameworks.
- Vendor-neutral and future-proof.

## Decision
We will adopt **OpenTelemetry** as the basis for our tracing and logging system.

**Justification:**
- It is the industry standard for open, vendor-neutral observability.
- It unifies previous standards (OpenTracing, OpenCensus), promoting simplicity and compatibility.
- Wide ecosystem support and active development.
- Facilitates seamless integration with existing tracing systems (Jaeger, Zipkin) and commercial services (Datadog, AWS X-Ray, etc).
- Modular architecture allows for incremental adoption and future extensibility.
- Rich support for metrics, logs, and traces in distributed environments.

## Consequences

**Trade-Offs and Impact:**

- **Pros:**
  - Vendor-agnostic: reduces lock-in and eases future migration.
  - Broad language/framework support.
  - Active community and rapid evolution.
  - Integrates with current and legacy tracing/logging backends.

- **Cons:**
  - Evolving standard; breaking changes and incomplete features can occur.
  - May require additional operational overhead versus fully-managed solutions.
  - Integration complexity for highly customized setups.
  - Smaller organizations may prefer simpler or vendor-specific tools (e.g., Datadog, Cloud-provider tracing).

**Comparison Against Alternatives:**
- Compared to **Prometheus**: OpenTelemetry covers logs and traces (not just metrics), but Prometheus is more battle-tested for metrics.
- Compared to **Jaeger/Zipkin**: These are focused on tracing alone; OpenTelemetry covers full observability, and can export to Jaeger/Zipkin.
- Compared to **Vendor Solutions**: OpenTelemetry avoids lock-in and gives more control, but vendors can simplify setup and offer advanced features out-of-the-box.

**Summary:**  
By adopting OpenTelemetry, we gain flexibility, interoperability, and reduce vendor risk. Some operational overhead and evolution risk remain, but this approach best fits our long-term engineering objectives for distributed tracing and logging.
