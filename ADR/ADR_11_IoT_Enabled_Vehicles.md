# ADR-11: IoT Security & Edge Computing for Vehicle Telemetry

## Status - accepted

## Context
Our automotive telematics platform requires collecting sensor and telemetry data from IoT-enabled vehicles to detect collisions (via accelerometer and other sensors), analyze driver behavior (speeding, collision events), and monitor battery health. The system must:

- **Secure data transmission** between vehicles and backend.
- **Process data at the edge** for real-time responsiveness.
- **Authenticate vehicle identity** to ensure data integrity and privacy.

Available alternatives include:
- Only cloud-based analytics, less edge processing
- Simple authentication (API keys, tokens) between devices and backend
- Event-driven analytics without ML or sensor fusion

## Decision
We will implement **mutual TLS (mTLS)** for secure authentication of IoT vehicles to the backend server, ensuring only valid devices send telemetry and battery data. Edge computing modules will process sensor data locallyâ€”detecting collision events and aggregating driver analytics (speeding events, collision frequency) before transmitting summaries to the backend.

**Justification:**
- mTLS provides strong cryptographic assurance of device identity and secure transmission.
- Edge computing delivers lower latency for safety-related features (collision detection), improves bandwidth efficiency, and supports real-time analytics.
- Local analysis enables quicker feedback and reduces backend load while maintaining rich, actionable insights (speed violations, collision stats).

## Consequences

**Trade-Offs and Impact:**

- **Pros:**
  - Security: mTLS prevents unauthorized data ingestion, isolates device streams, and protects data in transit.
  - Reliability: Edge analytics ensures collision detection is not dependent on cloud latency or connectivity.
  - Efficiency: Offloading processing to the edge conserves bandwidth and reduces backend compute costs.
  - Rich analytics: Enables granular driver analysis (over-speed, collision frequency) with summarized reporting to backend.

- **Cons:**
  - Added complexity and operational overhead in managing certificates and edge deployment.
  - Firmware updates needed for mTLS and analytics logic on IoT devices.
  - Some analytics might require backend processing for longitudinal, cross-vehicle analysis.

**Comparison Against Alternatives:**
- **Simple Auth (API keys/tokens):** Lower security, risks forged/fraudulent data streams.
- **Cloud-centric Analytics:** Higher latency for urgent events, significantly increased bandwidth usage.
- **No Edge Analytics:** Limits ability to respond in real time and puts heavy load on backend infrastructure.

**Summary:**
Applying mTLS for secure authentication and edge computing for sensor analysis provides a robust, scalable, and secure solution for vehicle IoT telemetry. This design prioritizes safety, privacy, and valuable driver behavior analytics, ensuring that only authenticated vehicles contribute trusted data to system monitoring and reporting.
