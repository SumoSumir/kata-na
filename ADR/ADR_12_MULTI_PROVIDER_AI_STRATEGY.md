# ADR-12: Multi-Provider AI Strategy

## Status
Accepted
**Date:** 2024-10-22

## Context
MobilityCorp's AI platform depends on multiple external AI services (LLMs for personalization and vision APIs for image understanding). Key risks identified include:

- Provider shutdowns (e.g., Anthropic/OpenAI discontinuing APIs)
- Cost volatility and sudden pricing model changes
- Rate limits or quota restrictions during traffic spikes
- Rapid evolution of new providers with better-performing models
- Vendor lock-in due to tight integration with a single provider
- Regional limitations and compliance restrictions (e.g., GDPR, data residency)

The platform therefore requires a resilient architecture that allows switching or routing across multiple AI providers dynamically.

## Decision
Implement a multi-provider AI abstraction layer that decouples application logic from specific AI vendors.

Key points of the decision:
- Introduce a common AI interface for all model interactions (LLM, embeddings, vision)
- Add routing logic that selects providers based on cost, latency, or reliability
- Support automatic failover when a provider experiences outages or throttling
- Maintain unified observability for cost, latency, and reliability across all providers
- Use configuration-based routing to adjust weights or deactivate providers without code changes

This ensures AI services can continue functioning seamlessly even if one provider changes pricing, introduces restrictions, or becomes unavailable.

## Consequences

✅ **Positive**
- Resilience against provider outages or pricing changes  
- Flexibility to adopt new AI providers without major refactors  
- Optimized cost-performance trade-offs via routing policies  
- Avoids vendor lock-in and supports regional compliance  
- Easier benchmarking and A/B testing across AI providers  

❌ **Negative**
- Higher engineering complexity to maintain multiple integrations  
- Slightly increased latency due to routing logic  
- Need for consistent schema and response normalization across providers  
- Ongoing maintenance for monitoring and provider updates  

## Alternatives Considered

**Single Provider Integration (e.g., only OpenAI)**  
- Pros: Simpler to integrate and maintain  
- Cons: High vendor lock-in, risk of service disruption, no flexibility  
- Rejected: Does not meet resilience or cost-control requirements  

**Provider-Specific SDKs per Service**  
- Pros: Direct access to provider features  
- Cons: Hard to switch, inconsistent interfaces, higher maintenance  
- Rejected: Increases code fragmentation and coupling  

## AI-Specific Considerations
- Enables runtime selection between LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.)  
- Allows model failover for real-time predictions and chat interactions  
- Supports experimentation and evaluation of new models seamlessly  
- Provides consistent observability for model cost, accuracy, and latency
