# ADR-09: Multi-Region Deployment and Region-Wise AI Model Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
MobilityCorp’s AI services operate across multiple geographies (e.g., India, EU, North America). Regional deployment of AI workloads is essential to meet latency, data compliance, and availability requirements.  

Challenges include:
- **Latency:** Centralized inference increases response time for distant regions.
- **Compliance:** Data privacy laws (GDPR, DPDP Act) require local data residency.
- **Availability:** Outages or throttling in one region should not impact global operations.
- **Model Variability:** Certain AI models or providers may perform better or be allowed only in specific regions.
- **Cost Optimization:** Different regions have varying compute and provider costs.

To ensure compliance, performance, and resilience, the AI platform needs a multi-region strategy with localized deployments and model routing.

## Decision
Adopt a **multi-region deployment architecture** combined with **region-aware model selection**.

Key components:
- **Regional AI Hubs:** Deploy inference services in key regions (e.g., `ap-south-1`, `eu-west-1`, `us-east-1`).
- **Data Residency Control:** Ensure user data is processed and stored within its originating region.
- **Model Registry per Region:** Maintain separate model configurations, versions, and providers per region.
- **Routing Layer:** A global gateway or service mesh directs traffic to the nearest compliant region.
- **Provider Selection:** Use preferred providers or models available in each region (e.g., OpenAI for US, Azure OpenAI for EU, local provider for India).
- **Failover Policy:** If a region’s models are unavailable, traffic is rerouted to a secondary region with compliance exceptions logged.

Example:
- India region → Uses Azure OpenAI (data stored in India)
- EU region → Uses Anthropic (GDPR compliant)
- US region → Uses OpenAI or Gemini depending on cost and latency

## Consequences

✅ **Positive**
- Reduced latency through regional inference  
- Compliance with local data protection laws  
- Improved fault tolerance and service continuity  
- Flexibility to use the best or allowed provider per region  
- Enables region-based A/B testing and performance optimization  

❌ **Negative**
- Increased infrastructure and DevOps complexity  
- Higher cost for maintaining multiple regional environments  
- Model version drift risk across regions  
- More complex monitoring and synchronization  

## Alternatives Considered

**Single Global Deployment**  
- Pros: Easier to maintain, lower operational cost  
- Cons: Violates data residency laws, higher latency for distant users  
- Rejected: Non-compliant for EU and India data protection  

**Multi-Region Data Only, Centralized AI Models**  
- Pros: Partial compliance for data storage  
- Cons: Inference still crosses borders, latency remains high  
- Rejected: Does not fully meet regulatory or performance goals  

## AI-Specific Considerations
- Each region maintains its own model registry and provider mapping.  
- Model performance monitoring is region-scoped to capture local variations.  
- Training data aggregation may require anonymization before cross-region transfers.  
- Supports progressive rollout of new models region by region.  
- Facilitates compliance audits with localized model and data control.
