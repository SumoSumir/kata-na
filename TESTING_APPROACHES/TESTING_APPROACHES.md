# Testing Approaches

A multi-layered testing strategy is essential to ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of the MobilityCorp platform. This strategy covers traditional software testing, specialized testing for AI/ML components, and integration into the CI/CD pipeline.

### 1. Foundational Software Testing

This layer focuses on the correctness of the individual microservices and their interactions.

-   **Unit Testing:**
    -   **Scope:** Each microservice has a comprehensive suite of unit tests focusing on its internal business logic.
    -   **Tools:** Standard frameworks for each language (e.g., Jest for Node.js, PyTest for Python).
    -   **Practice:** Dependencies on other services or databases are mocked. A high level of code coverage is enforced.

-   **Integration Testing:**
    -   **Scope:** Verifies the interaction and contracts between services. For example, ensuring the Booking service can correctly call the Payment service.
    -   **Tools:** Pact for consumer-driven contract testing to prevent breaking changes between services.
    -   **Practice:** Tests are run in a containerized environment that spins up the required dependent services.

-   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    -   **Scope:** Simulates complete user journeys through the system.
    -   **Examples:**
        -   A customer successfully books a scooter, completes the ride, and is charged correctly.
        -   A staff member receives a predictive maintenance alert and successfully completes the repair workflow.
    -   **Tools:** Cypress or Playwright for frontend testing; API-level tests for backend-only flows.

### 2. AI/ML Model & Data Testing

Testing AI/ML systems requires a different approach that focuses on data quality, model performance, and business impact.

-   **Offline Model Validation:**
    -   **Data Validation:** Before training, the dataset is automatically validated for schema correctness, statistical properties, and distribution drift compared to previous datasets.
    -   **Model Performance Evaluation:** After training, models are evaluated against a holdout test set using relevant metrics (e.g., MAPE for forecasting, precision/recall for classification).
    -   **Fairness and Bias Testing:** Models are audited to ensure they do not exhibit unintended bias across different user segments (e.g., by geography or demographic).
    -   **Robustness Testing:** Models are tested against adversarial or perturbed inputs to ensure they behave gracefully in unexpected scenarios.

-   **Online Model Validation:**
    -   **Shadow Deployment:** New models are deployed in "shadow mode," receiving live production traffic but not acting on their predictions. Their outputs are logged and compared against the currently active model to ensure performance parity or improvement.
    -   **A/B Testing / Canary Releases:** A new model is rolled out to a small subset of users. Its impact on key business metrics (e.g., revenue, customer satisfaction, operational cost) is measured before a full rollout.
    -   **Continuous Monitoring:** Live models are continuously monitored for performance degradation, data drift (changes in input data distribution), and concept drift (changes in the relationship between inputs and outputs). Alerts are triggered if performance drops below a set threshold.

### 3. Specialized Testing Strategies

-   **Event-Driven Architecture Testing:**
    -   **Schema Contract Testing:** The Avro schemas for all Kafka topics are managed in a Schema Registry. CI pipelines fail if a code change breaks schema compatibility.
    -   **Event Replay Simulation:** A dedicated testing environment allows for replaying historical production events from Kafka. This is used to test how new services or model versions behave under realistic, high-volume conditions.
    -   **Idempotency & Fault Tolerance Testing:** Tests are designed to ensure that event consumers can handle duplicate messages and recover gracefully from broker failures.

-   **Edge Case & Resilience Testing:**
    -   **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing:** The firmware and ML models for IoT edge devices are tested on actual hardware (or a close simulation) to validate performance under real-world constraints (e.g., connectivity loss, sensor noise).
    -   **Chaos Engineering:** We use tools to intentionally inject failures into the production environment during controlled experiments (e.g., terminating pods, introducing network latency) to verify that the system's fault tolerance and auto-healing mechanisms work as expected.

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline & Quality Gates

Testing is integrated directly into the CI/CD pipeline to automate quality assurance and prevent regressions.

-   **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    -   On every commit, the pipeline automatically runs:
        1.  Static code analysis and linting.
        2.  Unit tests and component tests.
        3.  Security vulnerability scans on code dependencies.
        4.  Builds the service into a container image.

-   **Continuous Deployment (CD) Quality Gates:**
    -   Before a service can be deployed to production, it must pass a series of automated gates in a staging environment:
        1.  **Integration Test Gate:** The full suite of integration tests must pass.
        2.  **E2E Test Gate:** All critical user journey E2E tests must pass.
        3.  **Model Performance Gate (for AI services):** The candidate model must meet or exceed the performance of the currently deployed model on a holdout dataset.
        4.  **Container Security Gate:** The container image is scanned for known vulnerabilities.
    -   A successful run through these gates allows for automated deployment to production, followed by a period of enhanced monitoring to detect any post-deployment issues for a potential automated rollback.
