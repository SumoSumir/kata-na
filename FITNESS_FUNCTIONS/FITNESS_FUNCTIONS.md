### System & Performance

-   **API Gateway Uptime**
    -   **Description:** Percentage of time the core API gateway is operational and serving requests.
    -   **Target:** > 99.95%
    -   **Justification:** Ensures core customer and staff functions are always available.

-   **P95 API Latency**
    -   **Description:** 95th percentile latency for critical APIs (e.g., booking, payment, unlock).
    -   **Target:** < 200ms
    -   **Justification:** Guarantees a responsive user experience for critical interactions.

-   **Vehicle Unlock Time**
    -   **Description:** Time from user request to vehicle unlocking.
    -   **Target:** < 3 seconds
    -   **Justification:** A key moment of truth in the customer journey; delays cause frustration.

-   **Scalability**
    -   **Description:** System supports N concurrent users and M vehicles without performance degradation.
    -   **Target:** N=100,000 users, M=50,000 vehicles
    -   **Justification:** Supports peak demand in multiple regions and allows for future growth.

### Operational Efficiency

-   **Predictive Maintenance Lead Time**
    -   **Description:** Average time between a maintenance prediction and the actual required maintenance event.
    -   **Target:** > 7 days
    -   **Justification:** Provides sufficient time for staff to schedule maintenance, minimizing vehicle downtime and service disruption.

-   **Rebalancing Task Completion Rate**
    -   **Description:** Percentage of AI-suggested rebalancing tasks completed by staff within the recommended timeframe.
    -   **Target:** > 90%
    -   **Justification:** Measures the effectiveness of the rebalancing algorithm and staff execution.

-   **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**
    -   **Description:** Average time taken to repair a vehicle after a fault is detected.
    -   **Target:** < 24 hours
    -   **Justification:** Reduces vehicle downtime, increasing availability and revenue potential.

-   **Vehicle Utilization Rate**
    -   **Description:** Percentage of time a vehicle is in a revenue-generating state (rented).
    -   **Target:** Increase by 15% YoY
    -   **Justification:** Directly measures the efficiency of the fleet and the impact of demand-shaping initiatives.

### Business & Financial

-   **Revenue Per Vehicle**
    -   **Description:** Average daily/monthly revenue generated by each vehicle in the fleet.
    -   **Target:** Increase by 20% YoY
    -   **Justification:** A primary indicator of financial health and the success of dynamic pricing and utilization strategies.

-   **Operational Cost Reduction**
    -   **Description:** Reduction in costs related to maintenance, rebalancing, and battery swaps.
    -   **Target:** > 10% YoY
    -   **Justification:** Measures the financial impact of AI-driven operational efficiencies.

-   **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
    -   **Description:** A measure of customer loyalty and satisfaction, based on a single-question survey.
    -   **Target:** > 50
    -   **Justification:** Indicates a positive customer experience, which is crucial for retention and brand reputation.

-   **Customer Churn Rate**
    -   **Description:** Percentage of customers who do not use the service again after a certain period.
    -   **Target:** < 5% per month
    -   **Justification:** High retention is more cost-effective than acquisition and signals a healthy service.

### AI/ML Model Performance

-   **Demand Forecast Accuracy (MAPE)**
    -   **Description:** Mean Absolute Percentage Error for vehicle demand forecasts at a zonal level (e.g., per city district).
    -   **Target:** < 15%
    -   **Justification:** Accurate forecasts are foundational for effective rebalancing, dynamic pricing, and staff allocation.

-   **Incentive ROI**
    -   **Description:** The return on investment for relocation incentives, measured as (Revenue Gain - Incentive Cost) / Incentive Cost.
    -   **Target:** > 2.0
    -   **Justification:** Ensures that the incentive program is profitable and effectively influencing user behavior.

-   **Dynamic Pricing Model Lift**
    -   **Description:** The percentage increase in revenue or utilization attributable to the dynamic pricing model compared to a fixed-price model.
    -   **Target:** > 10%
    -   **Justification:** Validates that the pricing algorithm is successfully optimizing revenue and adapting to market conditions.
