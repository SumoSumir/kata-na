# Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) define the quality attributes and operational characteristics of the system. They specify *how* the system should perform its functions, rather than *what* it should do.

---

### Scalability & Performance

-   **Scalability:** The system must scale horizontally to support a growing number of users, vehicles, and regions. Critical services (e.g., Telemetry, Booking) must scale independently.
-   **Performance:**
    -   **API Latency:** Critical API endpoints (booking, payment, unlock) must have a 95th percentile (P95) response time of less than 200ms.
    -   **Vehicle Unlock:** The end-to-end time from user request to vehicle unlock must be under 3 seconds.
    -   **AI Model Inference:** Real-time AI/ML models (e.g., dynamic pricing) must provide inferences with sub-second latency.
-   **Concurrency:** The platform must support at least 100,000 concurrent users and process telemetry from 50,000 vehicles simultaneously without performance degradation.

---

### Reliability & Availability

-   **High Availability:** Core services must achieve 99.95% uptime. The system should be resilient to individual component failures.
-   **Fault Isolation:** A failure in one microservice (e.g., reporting) must not cascade to impact critical services (e.g., booking or vehicle unlocking).
-   **Disaster Recovery:** The system must support multi-region failover for critical components to ensure business continuity in the event of a regional outage.
-   **Data Integrity:** The system must ensure the consistency and accuracy of data, especially for bookings, payments, and vehicle status.

---

### Security

-   **Authentication & Authorization:** All access to the system must be authenticated and authorized. This includes implementing OAuth2/JWT for APIs and mutual TLS (mTLS) for IoT devices.
-   **Data Encryption:** All data must be encrypted in transit (using TLS 1.3) and at rest.
-   **Network Security:** Services must be deployed within a secure network environment (e.g., VPCs with strict firewall rules).
-   **Vulnerability Management:** The system must be regularly scanned for security vulnerabilities, and patches must be applied in a timely manner.

---

### Compliance & Data Governance

-   **Data Residency:** The system must comply with regional data protection laws (GDPR, DPDP, CCPA) by ensuring user data is stored and processed within the user's geographical region.
-   **Privacy:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII) must be protected, and access must be strictly controlled. AI/ML models should be trained on anonymized or aggregated data wherever possible.
-   **Auditability:** The system must maintain audit trails for critical operations, such as data access, financial transactions, and system configuration changes.

---

### Observability

-   **Distributed Tracing:** The system must implement end-to-end distributed tracing to allow for debugging and performance analysis across microservices.
-   **Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring must be in place for all services, including infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory), application metrics (error rates, latency), and business KPIs.
-   **Logging:** All services must produce structured logs that can be centralized and searched for analysis and debugging.
-   **Alerting:** An automated alerting system must be in place to notify the operations team of system anomalies, performance degradation, or failures.

---

### Maintainability & Extensibility

-   **Modularity:** The system should be composed of loosely coupled, independently deployable microservices.
-   **Testability:** Each microservice should be independently testable. The architecture must support automated testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
-   **Extensibility:** The architecture must make it easy to add new features, vehicle types, or integrate with new third-party services without requiring major refactoring.
-   **Documentation:** The architecture and APIs must be well-documented to facilitate onboarding of new developers and teams.

---

### Usability & Accessibility

-   **User Experience:** The customer-facing mobile app and staff-facing dashboard must be intuitive and easy to use.
-   **Accessibility:** The applications should adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) to be usable by people with disabilities.
